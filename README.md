# flip / flap
A game of luck, guess, memory and match. 

It is a copy of a game I played long back on Windows Vista (Don't remember the name, propbably "Purble Place"). 

I have wrote the game in React JS from scratch. So, though the game idea is not mine, the implementation is entirely mine :-)

- [How to Play](https://github.com/codotronix/flip-flap#how-to-play)
- [Features and Plans](https://github.com/codotronix/flip-flap#features--plans)



## How to play

- Clicking on any card will reveal an image

- Each image is hiding behind exactly 2 cards

- The goal is to find all those pairs of cards which are holding the same image

- To score a match, each card of a pair must be clicked consecutively

- The goal is to have as less count as possible for clicks and repeat clicks


## Features / Plans

- [x] Create the game

- [x] In game scores / statistics e.g. Total Cicks, Repeat Clicks, Matches Found etc

- [ ] Home / landing screen

- [ ] Congratulation / Winner's Screen

- [ ] Game instructions / how to play

- [ ] Implement CI/CD with `Travis`

- [ ] Setup code unit testing coverage reporting with `Codecov` 

- [ ] Complete this readme file
