# flip / flap
A game of luck, guess, memory and match. 

It is a copy of a game I played long back on Windows Vista (Don't remember the name, propbably "Purble Place"). 

I have wrote the game in React JS from scratch. So, though the game idea is not mine, the implementation is entirely mine :-)

## How to play

- Clicking on any card will reveal an image

- Each image is hiding behind exactly 2 cards

- The goal is to find all those pairs of cards which are holding the same image

- To score a match, each card of a pair must be clicked consecutively

- The goal is to have as less count as possible for clicks and repeat clicks
